34 keys layout
==============

This is attempt to use tap-hold layout for 34 keys that is similar
to the one I have with Callum layout
(https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/16174). There are some
changes that make layers more accessible, tab key moved to thumb
key for faster access and some keys are moved as one shot is not
available with this layout.

Overall I like this more than Callum layout. Many shortcuts are
more sensible as they do not require one extra key (as with
Callum). I needed some time to get used to some differences and
tap-hold keys but move from Callum to this layout took me about
one hour.
